## Description
For this project, I used Java, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf refactored the back end of a news application originally built with Node and Handlebars. Just Tech News, lets users post links to tech-related articles, comment on other users' posts, and upvote posts.

The application was deployed using Heroku.
